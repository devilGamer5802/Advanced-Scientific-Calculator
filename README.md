## ✨ Key Features

*   **Arithmetic Operations:** Addition (`+`), Subtraction (`-`), Multiplication (`*`), Division (`/`).
*   **Scientific Functions:**
    *   Trigonometry: `sin`, `cos`, `tan` (operates on degrees).
    *   Logarithms: Natural Log (`ln`), Base-10 Log (`log10`).
    *   Powers & Roots: Square (`x^2`), Power (`x^y`), Square Root (`sqrt`).
    *   Constants: Pi (`π`), Euler's number (`e`).
    *   Other: Factorial (`n!`), Reciprocal (`1/x`), Percentage (`%`).
*   **Input Controls:**
    *   Digit Buttons (`0-9`), Decimal Point (`.`).
    *   Backspace (`<-`) to correct input.
    *   Clear Entry (`CE`) to clear the last input.
    *   All Clear (`C`) to reset the calculator state.
    *   Sign Toggle (`±`).
*   **💾 Memory Functions:**
    *   Memory Clear (`MC`).
    *   Memory Recall (`MR`).
    *   Memory Add (`M+`).
*   **📜 Calculation History:**
    *   View past calculations in a separate dialog.
    *   Option to clear history.
*   **💻 Modern UI:**
    *   Utilizes Java's Nimbus Look and Feel for improved aesthetics.
    *   Clear display with large font.
    *   Logical button layout.
*   **❗ Error Handling:** Gracefully handles invalid operations like division by zero, invalid function inputs (e.g., sqrt of negative), and number format errors.

## ⚙️ Technology Stack

*   **Core Language:** Java (Designed for JDK 24, compatible with recent versions)
*   **GUI Toolkit:** Java Swing
*   **Look and Feel:** Nimbus

## 🔧 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

**Prerequisites:**

*   Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or later (Tested with JDK 24). Ensure `javac` and `java` commands are in your system's PATH.
*   Git (for cloning the repository).

**Installation & Running:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/devilGamer5802/Scientific-Calculator.git
    cd Scientific-Calculator
    ```

2.  **Compile the Java code:**
    *   Navigate to the directory containing the `AdvancedScientificCalculator.java` file (if it's not in the root, adjust the path).
    *   Run the Java compiler:
        ```bash
        javac AdvancedScientificCalculator.java
        ```
    *   This will create an `AdvancedScientificCalculator.class` file.

3.  **Run the application:**
    *   Execute the compiled class using the Java Virtual Machine:
        ```bash
        java AdvancedScientificCalculator
        ```

4.  The calculator window should now appear on your screen.

## ▶️ Usage

*   Launch the application using the steps above.
*   Use the mouse to click the buttons for entering numbers and performing operations.
*   The top display field shows the current input or result.
*   Use `C` to clear everything, `CE` to clear the current entry, and `<-` to delete the last digit.
*   Access memory functions using `MC`, `MR`, `M+`.
*   Click the "History" button to view past calculations.
